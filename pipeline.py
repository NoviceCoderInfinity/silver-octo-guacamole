"""Core video -> multi-style caption pipeline.

Architecture (style-specialist + best-of-2 + facts-grounding + optional critique/repair;
Gemini may own the describe step when DESCRIBE_BACKEND=gemini):

  1. Extract evenly spaced frames. Ask Gemini (full video) OR Claude (frames) for a
     factual description PLUS concrete checkable facts.
  2. One SPECIALIST call per requested style (persona + tone exemplars + facts) writes
     two candidate captions taking different angles.
  3. One frame-grounded SELECTION call sees the actual frames plus all candidates and
     picks the best caption per style (accuracy to pixels + facts + unmistakable tone).
  4. Optional CRITIQUE/REPAIR (ENABLE_CRITIQUE_REPAIR) — off by default for the Gemini
     hybrid so describe-backend changes can be A/B'd cleanly against Arush's baseline.
